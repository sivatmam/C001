A variable is a named item representing a memory location used to hold a value.

An assignment stores a value into the memory location identified by a variable.

The assignment operator "=" is NOT equals as in algebra.  Only one variable is allowed to the
left of the assignment operator.

A variable declaration specifies the variable name and type.

An assignment statement puts the value of the expression on the right of the assignment operator
into the variable on the left.

An expression may be a number, another variable or a simple calculation.

An simple number, like 80, is known as an integer literal.
